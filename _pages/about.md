### Economics
My economic research focuses on the labor market from a macroeconomic perspective. My current project involves using Bayesian methods to cluster heterogeneous workers by income process. This method allows me to condition clustering on the heterogeneity, rather than other characteristics. With this in hand I can return to the data and evaluate how the algorithm separated the groups in relation to gender, age, race, union membership, and other traits which were not included in the original algorithm and therefore cannot be bad controls.

### Statistical Methods
I have an interest in computational methods, particularly numerical integration needed to perform Bayesian analysis. My expertise lies in time series analysis, with experience in hidden Markov models, time varying parameters, and stochastic volatility. I have also used panel data, including dynamic panels. I am familiar with machine learning techniques. However, for small and medium data sets, I prefer methods which keep the model intuitive and do not run the risk of bad controls and other mishaps in causal inference Naturally, if the objective is purely predictive and not causal, I relax this constraint.

### Programming abilities
My primary language has so far been Matlab/Octave, but I would like to transition to something without a license. To this end, I have been deepening my R and Python skills. A first goal is to design dashboards, including web scraping and utilizing APIs. After reading Edward Tufte, as we all should, I developed strong opinions on data visualization and plan on implementing them in anything I publish. As someone transitioning from academia to the private sector, my programming skills are likely slower than that of my peers. However, my theoretical knowledge is sufficient, and I expect to progress quickly in any role.

My relationship with Excel is complicated. Generally speaking, I would rather use SQL to store data and another program to process it. However, I realize that we are in an Excel world and have done my best to comply. I have similar feelings about Word and LaTeX.

### Other interests
I identify as a nerd and throw myself into topics as they catch me. This has included international relations, linguistics, history, ecology, composting (particularly vermicompost), and whitewater kayaking. By no means am I an expert in these, with the exception of whitewater, but I find it useful to keep myself entertained. It also fuels my creativity.
