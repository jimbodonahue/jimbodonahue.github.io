This blog is a place where I will collect scribblings on data methods, software I'm trying to use, and anything else that catches my interest at that particular moment. Everything is the subjective opinion of whatever version of James was working at that time and may be disavowed by any future James.

For information about a version of Past James, please see the [About](https://jimbodonahue.github.io/about/) page. For questions, feel free to email [Present James](mailto:jimbodonahue@gmail.com). For updates on Future James, you're welcome to [subscribe](https://jimbodonahue.github.io/feed.xml), but I take no responsibility for whatever that guy gets up to. He's wiley.

I claim to have no plans on updating. Maybe two in a day, maybe not again for a year. I'll try to start with a few old musings, but no promises. Thanks for reading!!
