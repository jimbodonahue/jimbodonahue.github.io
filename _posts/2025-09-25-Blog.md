# My path through learning about AWS

As I am currently pursuing an AWS certification program, it has me thinking about what already I know, and what I don't. In the coming months, I plan to document some of my struggles, as well as some of the things that I think don't get their due recognition.

This will naturally include a few rants which don't amount to a hill of beans, and I will try to keep these to a minimum. For example, principle component analysis is not feature selection, but merely dimensionality reduction. Such distinctions are pedantic and probably only important to me. I endeavor to keep them to myself.

I will instead try to busy myself with the things I learned in my years as an economist, the ways in which behaviors and statistical anomalies shape data analysis in ways that are not always readily apparent. The first post will stress the difference between a target and a metric. Feedback is always welcome, if for no other reason than to surprise me that some lost soul has found their way to my little musings.
